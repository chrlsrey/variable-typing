Step $1 \rightarrow 2$ is isothermal vaporization taking place in a boiler at temperature $T_{H}$, wherein heat is transferred to saturated-liquid water at rate $\dot{Q}_{H}$, producing saturated vapor. Step $2 \rightarrow 3$ is reversible adiabatic expansion of saturated vapor in a turbine producing a two-phase mixture of saturated liquid and vapor at $T_{C}$. This isentropic expansion is represented by a vertical line. Step $3 \rightarrow 4$ is an isothermal partial-condensation process at lower temperature $T_{C}$, wherein heat is transferred to the surroundings at rate $\dot{Q}_{C}$. Step $4 \rightarrow 1$ is an isentropic compression in a pump. Represented by a vertical line, it takes the cycle back to its origin, producing saturated-liquid water at point $1 .$ The power produced by the turbine $\dot{W}_{\text {turbine }}$ is much greater than the power requirement of the pump $\dot{W}_{\text {pump }}$, 

Clearly, $\eta$ increases as $T_{H}$ increases and as $T_{C}$ decreases. Although the efficiencies of practical heat engines are lowered by irreversibilities, it is still true that their efficiencies are increased when the average temperature at which heat is absorbed in the boiler is increased and when the average temperature at which heat is rejected in the condenser is decreased.

The steam supplied to a given feedwater heater must be at a pressure high enough that its saturation temperature is above that of the feedwater stream leaving the heater. We have here presumed a minimum temperature difference for heat transfer of no less than $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and have chosen extraction steam pressures such that the $t^{\text {sat }}$ values shown in the feedwater heaters are at least $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ greater than the exit temperatures of the feedwater streams. 

The thermal efficiency $\eta$ of the air-standard cycle shown in Fig. $8.9$ is simply:

The thermal efficiency is related in a simple way to the compression ratio, $r \equiv V_{C}^{i g} / V_{D}^{i g}$. Each temperature in Eq. (8.4) is replaced by an appropriate group $P V^{\mathrm{ig}} / R$. 

This equation shows that the thermal efficiency increases rapidly with the compression ratio $r$ at low values of $r$, but more slowly at high compression ratios. This agrees with the results of actual tests on Otto engines.

The idealization of the gas-turbine engine, called the Brayton cycle, is shown on a $P V$ diagram in Fig. 8.12. The working fluid is air in its ideal-gas state with constant heat capacities. Step $A B$ is a reversible adiabatic compression from $P_{A}$ (atmospheric pressure) to $P_{B}$. In step $B C$ heat $Q_{B C}$, replacing combustion, is added at constant pressure, raising the air temperature. A work-producing isentropic expansion of the air reduces the pressure from $P_{C}$ to $P_{D}$ (atmospheric pressure).
