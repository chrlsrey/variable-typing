The second, symbol $s$, the SI unit of time, is the duration of $9,192,631,770$ cycles of radiation associated with a specified transition of the cesium atom. The meter, symbol $\mathrm{m}$, is the fundamental unit of length, defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during $1 / 299,792,458$ of a second. The kilogram, symbol $\mathrm{kg}$, is the basic unit of mass, defined as the mass of a platinum/iridium cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at SÃ¨vres, France. (The gram, symbol $\mathrm{g}$, is $0.001 \mathrm{~kg}$.) Temperature is a characteristic dimension of thermodynamics, and is measured on the Kelvin scale, as described in Sec. 1.4. The mole, symbol mol, is defined as the amount of a substance represented by as many elementary entities (e.g., molecules) as there are atoms in $0.012 \mathrm{~kg}$ of carbon- 12.

The SI unit of force is the newton, symbol $N$, derived from Newton's second law, which expresses force $F$ as the product of mass $m$ and acceleration $a: F=m a$. Thus, a newton is the force that, when applied to a mass of $1 \mathrm{~kg}$, produces an acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}$, and is therefore a unit representing $1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}$. This illustrates a key feature of the SI system, namely, that derived units always reduce to combinations of primary units. Pressure $P$ (Sec. $1.5$), defined as the normal force exerted by a fluid on a unit area of surface, is expressed in pascals, symbol Pa. With force in newtons and area in square meters, $1 \mathrm{~Pa}$ is equivalent to $1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ or $1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Essential to thermodynamics is the derived unit for energy, the joule, symbol $\mathrm{J}$, defined as $1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}$ or $1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}$.

Multiples and decimal fractions of SI units are designated by prefixes, with symbol abbreviations, as listed in Table 1.1. Common examples of their use are the centimeter, $1 \mathrm{~cm}=10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$, the kilopascal, $1 \mathrm{kPa}=10^{3} \mathrm{~Pa}$, and the kilojoule, $1 \mathrm{~kJ}=10^{3} \mathrm{~J}$.

Two widely used units in engineering that are not part of SI, but are acceptable for use with it, are the bar, a pressure unit equal to $10^{2} \mathrm{kPa}$, and the liter, a volume unit equal to $10^{3} \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. The bar closely approximates atmospheric pressure. Other acceptable units are the minute, symbol min; hour, symbol h; day, symbol d; and the metric ton, symbol t; equal to $10^{3} \mathrm{~kg}$. Weight properly refers to the force of gravity on a body, expressed in newtons, and not to its mass, expressed in kilograms. Force and mass are, of course, directly related through Newton's law, with a body's weight defined as its mass times the local acceleration of gravity.

These measures for a specific system are in direct proportion to one another. Mass may be divided by the molar mass $\mathscr{M}$ (formerly called molecular weight) to yield number of moles: Total volume, representing the size of a system, is a defined quantity given as the product of three lengths. It may be divided by the mass or number of moles of the system to yield specific or molar volume: Specific or molar density is defined as the reciprocal of specific or molar volume: $\rho \equiv V^{-1}$. These quantities ($V$ and $\rho$) are independent of the size of a system, and are examples of intensive thermodynamic variables.

The Kelvin scale, which we indicate with the symbol $T$, provides SI temperatures. An absolute scale, it is based on the concept of a lower limit of temperature, called absolute zero. Its unit is the kelvin, symbol $\mathrm{K}$. Celsius temperatures, with symbol $t$, are defined in relation to Kelvin temperatures: The unit of Celsius temperature is the degree Celsius, ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is equal in size to the kelvin. However, temperatures on the Celsius scale are $273.15$ degrees lower than on the Kelvin scale. Thus absolute zero on the Celsius scale occurs at $-273.15^{\circ} \mathrm{C} .

The primary standard for pressure measurement is the dead-weight gauge in which a known force is balanced by fluid pressure acting on a piston of known area: $P \equiv F / A$. The basic design is shown in Fig. 1.2. Objects of known mass ("weights") are placed on the pan until the pressure of the oil, which tends to make the piston rise, is just balanced by the force of gravity on the piston and all that it supports. With this force given by Newton's law, the pressure exerted by the oil is: where $m$ is the mass of the piston, pan, and "weights"; $g$ is the local acceleration of gravity; and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the piston.

The mass is given by: $m=A h \rho$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the column, $h$ is its height, and $\rho$ is the fluid density. The pressure to which a fluid height corresponds is determined by the density of the fluid (which depends on its identity and temperature) and the local acceleration of gravity. A unit of pressure in common use (but not an SI unit) is the standard atmosphere, representing the average pressure exerted by the earth's atmosphere at sea level, and defined as $101.325 \mathrm{kPa}$.

Work, $W$, is performed whenever a force acts through a distance. By its definition, the quantity of work is given by the equation: where $F$ is the component of force acting along the line of the displacement $d l$. The SI unit of work is the newton-meter or joule, symbol J.

Equation (1.4) expresses the work done by a finite compression or expansion process. Figure $1.3$ shows a path for compression of a gas from point 1, initial volume $V_{1}^{t}$ at pressure $P_{1}$, to point 2, volume $V_{2}^{t}$ at pressure $P_{2}$. This path relates the pressure at any point of the process to the volume.

When a body of mass $m$, acted upon by a force $F$, is displaced a distance $d l$ during a differential interval of time $d t$, the work done is given by Eq. (1.2). In combination with Newton's second law this equation becomes: By definition the acceleration is $a \equiv d u / d t$, where $u$ is the velocity of the body. Because the definition of velocity is $u \equiv d l / d t$, this expression for work reduces to:

Each of the quantities $\frac{1}{2} m u^{2}$ in Eq. (1.5) is a kinetic energy, a term introduced by Lord Kelvin in $1856$. Thus, by definition, Equation (1.5) shows that the work done on a body in accelerating it from an initial velocity $u_{1}$ to a final velocity $u_{2}$ is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the body. Conversely, if a moving body is decelerated by the action of a resisting force, the work done by the body is equal to its change in kinetic energy. With mass in kilograms and velocity in meters/second, kinetic energy $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ is in joules, where $1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}=1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}$. In accord with Eq. (1.5), this is the unit of work.

When a body of mass $m$ is raised from an initial elevation $z_{1}$ to a final elevation $z_{2}$, an upward force at least equal to the weight of the body is exerted on it, and this force moves through the distance $z_{2}-z_{1}$. Because the weight of the body is the force of gravity on it, the minimum force required is given by Newton's law: where $g$ is the local acceleration of gravity. The minimum work required to raise the body is the product of this force and the change in elevation: We see from Eq. (1.7) that work done on a body in raising it is equal to the change in the quantity $m z g$. Conversely, if a body is lowered against a resisting force equal to its weight, the work done by the body is equal to the change in the quantity $m z g$. Each of the quantities $m z g$ in Eq. (1.7) is a potential energy.

With mass in $\mathrm{kg}$, elevation in $\mathrm{m}$, and the acceleration of gravity in $\mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}, E_{P}$ is in joules, where $1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-2}=1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m} .$ In accord with Eq. $(1.7)$, this is the unit of work.

A reasonable view is that something is transferred from the hot object to the cold one, and we call that something heat $Q$.

With heat now understood to be a form of energy, its SI unit is the joule. The SI unit of power is the watt, symbol $W$, defined as an energy rate of one joule per second.
