As indicated in Sec. 5.2, a refrigerator is a heat pump that absorbs heat from a region at a temperature below that of the surroundings and rejects heat to the surroundings. It operates with the highest possible efficiency on a Carnot refrigeration cycle, the reverse of the Carnot engine cycle, as shown by Fig. 5.1(b). The two isothermal steps provide heat absorption $Q_{C}$ at the lower temperature $T_{C}$ and heat rejection $Q_{H}$ at the higher temperature $T_{H}$. The cycle is completed by two adiabatic steps between these two temperatures. The cycle requires the addition of net work $W$ to the system. Because all steps of the cycle are reversible, it gives the minimum possible work required for a given refrigeration effect.

The working fluid operates in a cycle for which $\Delta U$ is zero. The first law for the cycle is therefore: 

where we note that $Q_{C}$ is a positive number and $Q_{H}$ (larger in absolute value) is negative. The measure of the effectiveness of a refrigerator is its coefficient of performance $\omega$, defined as: 

Equation (9.1) may be divided by $Q_{C}$ and then combined with Eq. (5.4): 

For example, refrigeration at a temperature level of 5${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in surroundings at 30${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, gives: 

It shows clearly that the refrigeration effect per unit of work decreases as the temperature of heat absorption $T_{C}$ decreases and as the temperature of heat rejection $T_{H}$ increases. 

The vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is represented in Fig. 9.1, along with a TS diagram showing the four steps of the process. A liquid refrigerant evaporating at constant $T$ and $P$ absorbs heat (line 1 → 2), producing the refrigeration effect. The vapor produced is compressed via dashed line 2 → 3′ for isentropic compression (Fig. 7.6), and via line 2 → 3, sloping in the direction of increasing entropy, for an actual compression process, reflecting inherent irreversibilities. At this higher $T$ and $P$, it is cooled and condensed (line 3 → 4) with rejection of heat to the surroundings. Liquid from the condenser expands (line 4 → 1) to its original pressure. In principle, this can be carried out in a turbine from which work is obtained. However, for practical reasons it is usually accomplished by throttling through a partly open control valve. The pressure drop in this irreversible process results from fluid friction in the valve. As shown in Sec. 7.1, the throttling process occurs at constant enthalpy. 

These equations follow from Eq. (2.31) when the small changes in potential and kinetic energy are neglected. The work of compression is simply: $W=H_{3}-H_{2}$, and by Eq. (9.2), the coefficient of performance is: 

To design the evaporator, compressor, condenser, and auxiliary equipment one must know the rate of circulation of refrigerant $\dot{m}$ . This is determined from the rate of heat absorption in the evaporator by the equation

For given $T_{C}$ and $T_{H}$, vapor-compression refrigeration results in lower values of $\omega$ than the Carnot cycle because of irreversibilities in expansion and compression.  The following example provides an indication of typical values for coefficients of performance. 

Limits placed on the operating pressures of the evaporator and condenser of a refrigeration system also limit the temperature difference $T_{H}-T_{C}$ over which a simple vapor-compression cycle can operate. With $T_{H}$ fixed by the temperature of the surroundings, a lower limit is placed on the temperature level of refrigeration. This can be overcome by the operation of two or more refrigeration cycles employing different refrigerants in a cascade. A two-stage cascade is shown in Fig. 9.3. 

If tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) is the refrigerant in cycle 2, then the intake and discharge pressures for the compressor are about 1.6 bar and 7.7 bar, and the pressure ratio is about 4.9. If difluoromethane (R32) is the refrigerant in cycle 1, these pressures are about 1.1 and 5.8 bar, and the pressure ratio is about 5.3. These are all reasonable values. On the other hand, for a single cycle operating between −50${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 30${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with HFC-134a as refrigerant, the intake pressure to the condenser is about 0.29 bar, well below atmospheric pressure. Moreover, for a discharge pressure of about 7.7 bar the pressure ratio is 26, too high to achieve with a single-stage compressor. 

In vapor-compression refrigeration the work of compression is usually supplied by an electric motor. But the source of the electric energy is most likely a heat engine (central power plant) used to drive a generator. Thus the work for refrigeration comes ultimately from a heat engine. This suggests a combination of cycles wherein work produced by an engine cycle is used internally by a coupled refrigeration cycle in a device that takes in heat both at elevated temperature $T_{H}$ and at cold temperature $T_{C}$ and rejects heat to the surroundings at $T_{S}$. Before considering practical absorption- refrigeration processes, we first treat a combination of Carnot cycles that produce this effect. 

The work required by a Carnot refrigerator absorbing heat at temperature $T_{C}$ and rejecting heat at the temperature of the surroundings $T_{S}$ follows from Eqs. (9.2) and (9.3): 

where $T_{S}$ replaces $T_{H}$ and $Q_{C}$ is the heat absorbed. If a source of heat is available at a temperature $T_{H}>T_{S}$, then this work may be obtained from a Carnot engine operating between $T_{H}$ and $T_{S}$. The heat required $Q_{H}$ for the production of work is found from Eq. (5.5), where we have substituted $T_{S}$ for $T_{C}$ and changed the sign of $W$, because $W$ in Eq. (5.5) refers to a Carnot engine, but here it refers to the refrigerator: 

The value of $Q_{H} / Q_{C}$ given by this equation is of course a minimum because Carnot cycles cannot be achieved in practice. It provides a limiting value for absorption refrigeration. 

A schematic diagram for a typical absorption refrigerator is shown in Fig. 9.4. Note that just as in the preceding derivation, $W$ is eliminated, and both $Q_{H}$ and $Q_{C}$  enter the system, with heat discarded only to the surroundings. The essential difference between a vapor-compression and an absorption refrigerator is in the different means employed for compression. The section of the absorption unit to the right of the dashed line in Fig. 9.4 is the same as in a vapor- compression refrigerator, but the section to the left accomplishes compression by what amounts to a heat engine. Refrigerant as vapor from the evaporator is absorbed in a relatively nonvolatile liquid solvent at the pressure of the evaporator and at relatively low temperature. The heat given off in the process is discarded to the surroundings at $T_{S}$. The liquid solution from the absorber, which contains a relatively high concentration of refrigerant, passes to a pump, which raises the pressure of the liquid to that of the condenser. Heat from the higher temperature source at $T_{H}$  is transferred to the compressed liquid solution, raising its temperature and evaporating the refrigerant from the solvent. Vapor passes from the regenerator to the condenser, and solvent, which now contains a relatively low concentration of refrigerant, returns to the absorber by way of a heat exchanger, which serves to conserve energy and adjust stream temperatures toward optimum values. Low-pressure steam is the usual source of heat for the regenerator. 

Consider refrigeration at a temperature level of −10${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($T_{C}=263.15 \mathrm{~K}$) with a heat source of condensing steam at atmospheric pressure ($T_{H}=373.15 \mathrm{~K}$). For a surroundings temperature of 30${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($T_{S}=303.15 \mathrm{~K}$), the minimum possible value of $Q_{H} / Q_{C}$ is found from Eq. (9.6): 

The heat pump, a reversed heat engine, is a device for heating houses and commercial buildings during the winter and cooling them during the summer. In the winter it operates so as to absorb heat from the surroundings and reject heat into the building. Refrigerant evaporates in coils placed underground or in the outside air; vapor compression is followed by condensation, heat being transferred to air or water, which is used to heat the building. Compression must be to a pressure such that the condensation temperature of the refrigerant is higher than the required temperature level of the building. The operating cost of the installation is the cost of electric power to run the compressor. If the unit has a coefficient of performance $Q_{C} / W=4$, the heat available to heat the house $Q_{H}$ is equal to five times the energy input to the compressor. Any economic advantage of the heat pump as a heating device depends on the cost of electricity in comparison with the cost of fuels such as oil and natural gas. 

The three methods are illustrated in Fig. 9.5. The constant-pressure process (1) approaches the two-phase region (and liquefaction) most closely for a given drop in temperature. The throttling process (3) does not result in liquefaction unless the initial state is at a low enough temperature and high enough pressure for the constant-enthalpy process to cut into the two-phase region. This is indeed the situation for an initial state at A′, but not at A, where the temperature is the same but the pressure is lower than at A. The change of state from A to A′ may be accomplished by compression of the gas to the pressure at B and constant-pressure cooling to A′. Reference to a PH diagram for air shows that at a temperature of 160 $\mathbf{K}$, the pressure must be greater than about 80 bar for any liquefaction to occur along a path of constant enthalpy. Thus, if air is compressed to at least 80 bar and cooled below 160 $\mathbf{K}$, it can be partially liquefied by throttling. An efficient process for cooling the gas is by countercurrent heat exchange with that portion of the gas which does not liquefy in the throttling process. 

The throttling process (3) is commonly employed in small-scale commercial liquefaction plants. The temperature of the gas must decrease during expansion, and this indeed occurs with most gases at usual conditions of temperature and pressure. The exceptions are hydrogen and helium, which increase in temperature upon throttling unless the initial temperature is below about 100 $\mathbf{K}$ for hydrogen and 20 $\mathbf{K}$ for helium. Liquefaction of these gases by throttling requires initial cooling to temperatures lower than obtained by method 1 or 2. 

The Linde liquefaction process, which depends solely on throttling expansion, is shown in Fig. 9.6. After compression, the gas is precooled to ambient temperature. It may be even further cooled by refrigeration. The lower the temperature of the gas entering the throttle valve, the greater the fraction of gas that is liquefied. For example, a refrigerant evaporating in the cooler at −40${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$  provides a lower temperature at the valve than if water at 20${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$  is the cooling medium. 

If the expander operates adiabatically, $\dot{W}_{\text {out }}$ as given by Eq. (7.13) is: 

Moreover, by a mass balance, $\dot{m}_{15}=\dot{m}_{4}-\dot{m}_{9}$. The energy balance, after division by $\dot{m}_{4}$, there- fore becomes: 

With the definitions, $z \equiv \dot{m}_{9} / \dot{m}_{4}$ and $x \equiv \dot{m}_{12} / \dot{m}_{4}$, solution of this equation for z yields: 

In this equation $z$ is the fraction of the stream entering the heat-exchanger system that is liquefied, and $x$ is the fraction of this stream that is drawn off between the heat exchangers and passed through the expander. This latter quantity ($x$) is a design variable and must be specified before Eq. (9.7) can be solved for $z$. Note that the Linde process results when $x=0$, and in this event Eq. (9.7) reduces to:
