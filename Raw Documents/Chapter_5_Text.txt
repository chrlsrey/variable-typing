Axiom 4: There exists a property called entropy $\mathbf{S}$, which for systems at internal equilibrium is an intrinsic property, functionally related to the measurable state variables that characterize the system. Differential changes in this property are given by the equation: where $S^{t}$ is the system (rather than the molar) entropy.

entropy change of a heat reservoir follows from Eq. (5.1). Because $T$ is constant, integration gives: A quantity of heat $Q$ is transferred to or from a reservoir at temperature $T$. From the reservoir's point of view the transfer is reversible, because its effect on the reservoir is the same regardless of source or sink of the heat. Let the temperatures of the reservoirs be $T_{H}$ and $T_{C}$ with $T_{H}>T_{C}$. Heat quantity $Q$. transferred from one reservoir to the other, is the same for both reservoirs. However, $Q_{H}$ and $Q_{C}$ have opposite signs: positive for the heat added to one reservoir and negative for the heat extracted from the other. Therefore $Q_{H}=-Q_{C}$. and the entropy changes of the reservoirs at $T_{H}$ and at $T_{C}$ are:

Because the heat-transfer process is irreversible, Eq. (5.2) requires a positive value for $\Delta S_{\text {total }}$, and therefore: With the temperature difference positive, $Q_{C}$ must also be positive, which means that heat flows into the reservoir at $T_{C}$, i.e., from the higher to the lower temperature. This result conforms to universal experience that heat flows from higher to lower temperature. A formal statement conveys this result: No process is possible which consists solely of the transfer of heat from one temperature level to a higher one. Note also that $\Delta S_{\text {total }}$ becomes smaller as the temperature difference decreases. When $T_{H}$ is only infinitesimally higher than $T_{C}$, the heat transfer is reversible, and $\Delta S_{\text {total }}$ approaches zero.

The second law imposes restrictions on how much of their heat intake can be converted into work, and our object now is to establish quantitatively this relationship. We imagine that the engine receives heat from a higher-temperature heat reservoir at $T_{H}$ and discards heat to a lower-temperature reservoir $T_{C}$. The engine is taken as the system and the two heat reservoirs comprise the surroundings. The work and heat quantities in relation to both the engine and the heat reservoirs are shown in Fig. 5.1(a). With respect to the engine, the first law as given by Eq. (2.3) becomes:

Because the engine inevitably operates in cycles, its properties over a cycle do not change. Therefore $\Delta U=0$, and $W=-Q_{H}-Q_{C}$. The entropy change of the surroundings equals the sum of the entropy changes of the reservoirs. Because the entropy change of the engine over a cycle is zero, the total entropy change is that of the heat reservoirs. Therefore: Note that $Q_{C}$ with respect to the engine is a negative number, whereas $Q_{H}$ is positive. Combining this equation with the equation for $W$ to eliminate $Q_{H}$ yields:

Note again that $Q_{C}$ is a negative number, as it represents heat transferred from the engine. This makes $W$ negative, in accord with the fact that work is not added to, but is produced by, the engine. Clearly, for any finite value of $W$, $Q_{C}$ is also finite. This means that a portion of the heat transferred from the higher-temperature reservoir must inevitably be exhausted to the lower-temperature reservoir. This observation can be given formal statement:

Note that in application to a Carnot engine $Q_{H}$, representing heat transferred to the engine, is a positive number, making the work produced $(W)$ negative. In Eq. (5.4) the smallest possible value of $Q_{C}$ is zero; the corresponding value of $T_{C}$ is absolute zero on the Kelvin scale, which corresponds to $-273.15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of the work produced to the heat supplied to the engine. With respect to the engine, the work $W$ is negative. Thus, In view of Eq. (5.5) the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine is:

Although a Carnot engine operates reversibly in all respects, and cannot be improved, its efficiency approaches unity only when $T_{H}$ approaches infinity or $T_{C}$ approaches zero. Neither condition exists on earth; all terrestrial heat engines therefore operate with thermal efficiencies less than unity. The cold reservoirs available on earth are the atmosphere, lakes, rivers, and oceans, for which $T_{C} \simeq 300 \mathrm{~K}$. Hot reservoirs are objects such as furnaces where the temperature is maintained by combustion of fossil fuels or by fission of radioactive elements, and for which $T_{H} \simeq 600 \mathrm{~K}$. With these values, $\eta=1-300 / 600=0.5$, an approximate realistic limit for the thermal efficiency of a Carnot engine. Actual heat engines are irreversible, and $\eta$ rarely exceeds $0.35$.

Step 1: A system at an initial temperature of a cold reservoir at $T_{C}$ undergoes a reversible adiabatic process that causes its temperature to rise to that of a hot reservoir at $T_{H}$. Step 2: The system maintains contact with the hot reservoir at $T_{H}$ and undergoes a reversible isothermal process during which heat $Q_{H}$ is absorbed from the hot reservoir. Step 3: The system undergoes a reversible adiabatic process in the opposite direction of Step 1 that brings its temperature back to that of the cold reservoir at $T_{C}$. Step 4: The system maintains contact with the reservoir at $T_{C}$, and undergoes a reversible isothermal process in the opposite direction of Step 2 that returns it to its initial state with rejection of heat $Q_{C}$ to the cold reservoir.

$a \rightarrow b$ Adiabatic compression with temperature rising from $T_{C}$ to $T_{H}$. $b \rightarrow c$ Isothermal expansion to arbitrary point $c$ with absorption of heat $Q_{H}$. $c \rightarrow d$ Adiabatic expansion with temperature decreasing to $T_{C}$. $d \rightarrow a$ Isothermal compression to the initial state with rejection of heat $Q_{C}$.

Points $A$ and $B$ on the $P V^{t}$ diagram of Fig. $5.3$ represent two equilibrium states of a particular fluid, and paths $A C B$ and $A D B$ represent two arbitrary reversible processes connecting these points. Integration of Eq. (5.1) for each path gives:

Because $\Delta S^{t}$ is a property change, it is independent of path and is given by $S_{B}^{t}-S_{A}^{t}$. If the fluid is changed from state $A$ to state $B$ by an irreversible process, the entropy change is again $\Delta S^{t}=S_{B}^{t}-S_{A}^{t}$, but experiment shows that this result is not given by $\int d Q / T$ evaluated for the irreversible process itself, because the calculation of entropy changes by this integral must, in general, be along reversible paths. The entropy change of a heat reservoir, however, is always given by $Q / T$, where $Q$ is the quantity of heat transferred to or from the reservoir at temperature $T$, whether the transfer is reversible or irreversible. As noted earlier, the effect of heat transfer on a heat reservoir is the same regardless of the temperature of the source or sink of the heat. If a process is reversible and adiabatic, $d Q_{\text {rev }}=0$; then by Eq. (5.1), $d S^{t}=0$. Thus the entropy of a system is constant during a reversible adiabatic process, and the process is said to be isentropic.

For the ideal-gas state, $d H^{i g}=C_{P}^{i g} d T$ and $V^{i g}=R T / P$. With these substitutions and division by $T$, As a result of Eq. (5.1), this becomes: where $S^{i g}$ is the molar entropy for the ideal-gas state. Integration from an initial state at conditions $T_{0}$ and $P_{0}$ to a final state at conditions $T$ and $P$ gives:

Equation (4.5) for the temperature dependence of the molar heat capacity $C_{P}^{i g}$ allows integration of the first term on the right of Eq. (5.10). The result can be written as:

The subscript $S$ denotes a mean value specific to entropy calculations.

The equivalent equation of entropy balance is: where $\dot{S}_{G}$ is the rate of entropy generation. This equation is the general rate form of the entropy balance, applicable at any instant. Each term can vary with time. The first term is the time rate of change of the total entropy of the fluid contained within the control volume. The second term is the net rate of gain in entropy of the flowing streams, i.e., the difference between the total entropy transported out by exit streams and the total entropy transported in by entrance streams. The third term is the time rate of change of the entropy of the surroundings, resulting from heat transfer between system and surroundings.

Let rate of heat transfer $\dot{Q}_{j}$ with respect to a particular part of the control surface be associated with $T_{\sigma j}$ where subscript $\sigma, j$ denotes a temperature in the surroundings. The rate of entropy change in the surroundings as a result of this transfer is then $-\dot{Q}_{j} / T_{\sigma, j}$. The minus sign converts $Q_{j}$, defined with respect to the system, to a heat transfer rate with respect to the surroundings. The third term in Eq. (5.15) is therefore the sum of all such quantities:

The final term, representing the rate of entropy generation $\dot{S}_{G}$, reflects the second-law requirement that it be positive for irreversible processes. There are two sources of irreversibility:

In the present instance, a continuous process takes in saturated steam at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and makes heat $Q$ continuously available at a temperature level of $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Because cooling water is available at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the maximum possible use is made of the steam if it is condensed and cooled (without freezing) to this exit temperature and discharged at atmospheric pressure. This is a limiting case (most favorable to the inventor), and requires a heat-exchange surface of infinite area.

It is not possible in this process for heat to be liberated only at the $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ temperature level, because as we have shown no process is possible that does nothing except transfer heat from one temperature level to a higher one. We must therefore suppose that some heat $Q_{\sigma}$ is transferred to the cooling water at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Moreover, the process must satisfy the first law; thus by Eq. (2.32): where $\Delta H$ is the enthalpy change of the steam as it flows through the system. Because no shaft work accompanies the process, $W_{s}=0$.

For such a process, the entropy generation is zero, and Eq. (5.17), written for a uniform surroundings temperature $T_{\sigma}$, becomes: Substituting this expression for $\dot{Q}$ in the energy balance, Eq. (2.29): The shaft work, $\dot{W}_{s}(\mathrm{rev})$, is here the work of a completely reversible process. If $\dot{W}_{s}(\mathrm{rev})$ is given the name ideal work, $\dot{W}_{\text {ideal }}$, the preceding equation may be rewritten:

Our objective is to compare the actual work of a process $\dot{W}_{s}$ (or $\left.W_{s}\right)$ as given by an energy balance to the ideal work as given by Eqs. (5.19) through (5.22) for a hypothetical reversible process that produces the same property changes. No description of the hypothetical process is required, as it may always be imagined (see Ex. 5.7).

When $\dot{W}_{\text {ideal }}$ (or $\left.W_{\text {ideal }}\right)$ is positive, it is the minimum work required to bring about a given change in the properties of the flowing streams, and is smaller than $W_{s}$ In this case a thermodynamic efficiency $\eta_{t}$ is defined as the ratio of the ideal work to the actual work:

When $\dot{W}_{\text {ideal }}$ (or $\left.W_{\text {ideal }}\right)$ is negative, $\left|\dot{W}_{\text {ideal }}\right|$ is the maximum work obtainable from a given change in the properties of the flowing streams, and is larger than $\left|\dot{W}_{s}\right|$. In this case, the thermodynamic efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual work to the ideal work:

Work that is wasted as the result of irreversibilities in a process is called lost work, $W_{\text {lost }}$, and is defined as the difference between the actual work of a change of state and the ideal work for the same change of state. Thus by definition,

For the case of a single surroundings temperature $T_{\sigma}$, the steady-state entropy balance, Eq. (5.17), becomes:

As a consequence of the second law, $\dot{S}_{G} \geq 0$; it follows that $\dot{W}_{\text {lost }} \geq 0$. When a process is completely reversible, the equality holds, and $\dot{W}_{\text {lost }}=0$. For irreversible processes the inequality holds, and $\dot{W}_{\text {lost }}$ i.e., the energy that becomes unavailable for work, is positive.

For the special case of a single stream flowing through the control volume, $\dot{m}$ factors and becomes a multiplier of the entropy difference in Eqs. (5.27) and (5.28) Division by $\dot{m}$ converts all terms to the basis of a unit amount of fluid flowing through the control volume. Thus,

Recall here that $\dot{Q}$ and $Q$ represent heat exchange with the surroundings, but with the sign referred to the system. Equations (5.31) and (5.33) combine for a unit amount of fluid to give:

If the entropy is zero at $T=0 \mathrm{~K}$, then Eq. (5.1) lends itself to the calculation of absolute entropies. With $T=0$ as the lower limit of integration, the absolute entropy of a gas at temperature $T$ based on calorimetric data is:

This equation is based on the supposition that no solid-state transitions take place and thus no heats of transition need appear. The only constant-temperature heat effects are those of melting at $T_{f}$ and vaporization at $T_{v}$. When a solid-phase transition occurs, a term $\Delta H_{t} / T_{t}$ is added.

Note that although the third law implies that absolute values of entropy are obtainable, for most thermodynamic analyses, only relative values are needed. As a result, reference states other than the perfect crystal at $0 \mathrm{~K}$ are commonly used. For example, in the steam tables of App. E, saturated liquid water at $273.16 \mathrm{~K}$ is taken as the reference state and assigned zero entropy. However, the absolute or "third law" entropy of saturated liquid water at $273.16 \mathrm{~K}$ is $3.515 \mathrm{~kJ} \cdot \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{-1}$.

Suppose an insulated container, partitioned into two equal volumes, contains Avogadro’s number $N_{A}$ of molecules in one section and no molecules in the other.

The means for expressing disorder in a quantitative way was developed by L. Boltzmann and J. W. Gibbs through a quantity $\Omega$, defined as the number of different ways that microscopic particles can be distributed among the "states" accessible to them. It is given by the general formula: where $N$ is the total number of particles, and $N_{1}, N_{2}, N_{3}$, etc., represent the numbers of particles in "states" $1,2,3$, etc. The term "state" denotes a condition of the microscopic particles, and the quotation marks distinguish this idea of state from the usual thermodynamic meaning as applied to a macroscopic system.

With respect to our example there are but two "states" for each molecule, representing location of the given molecule in one half or the other of the container. The total number of particles is $N_{A}$ molecules, and initially they are all in a single "state."

This expression gives a very large number for $\Omega_{2}$, indicating that the molecules can be distributed uniformly between the two "states" in many different ways. Many other values of $\Omega_{2}$ are possible, each one of which is associated with a particular nonuniform distribution of the molecules between the two halves of the container. The ratio of a particular $\Omega_{2}$ to the sum of all possible values is the probability of that particular distribution. The connection established by Boltzmann between entropy $S$ and $\Omega$ is given by the equation:
