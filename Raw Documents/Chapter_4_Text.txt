When the system is a homogeneous substance of constant composition, the phase rule indicates that fixing the values of two intensive properties establishes its state. The molar or specific internal energy of a substance may therefore be expressed as a function of two other state variables. The key thermodynamic variable is temperature. With molar or specific volume chosen arbitrarily, we have $U=U(T, V)$. With the definition of $C_{V}$ provided by Eq. (2.15) this becomes:
Although real liquids are to some degree compressible, far below their critical temperature they can often be treated as incompressible fluids. The ideal-gas state is also of interest, because actual gases at low pressures approach ideality.The only possible mechanically reversible constant-volume process is simple heating (stirring work is inherently irreversible), for which $Q=\Delta U$, and Eq. (2.18) written for a unit mass or a mole becomes: The enthalpy may be treated similarly, with molar or specific enthalpy expressed most conveniently as a function of temperature and pressure. Then $H=H(T, P)$ With the definition of $C_{P}$ provided by Eq. (2.19),
Moreover $Q=\Delta H$ for mechanically reversible, constant-pressure, closed-system processes [Eq. (2.22)] and for the transfer of heat in steady-flow processes where $\Delta E_{P}$ and $\Delta E_{K}$ are negligible and $W_{s}=0$ [Eq. (2.32)].
This equation finds frequent application for flow processes designed for simple heating and cooling of gases, liquids, and solids.

whe $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants characteristic of the particular substance. With the exception of the last term, these equations are of the same form. We therefore combine them to provide a single expression:
wher either $C$ or $D$ is usually zero, depending on the substance considered.1 Because the ratio $C_{P} / R$ is dimensionless, the units of $C_{P}$  are governed by the choice of $R$. The parameters are independent of temperature, but, at least in principle, depend on the value of the constant pressure. However, for liquids and solids the effect of pressure is usually very small. Values of the constants for selected solids and liquids are given in Tables C.2 and C.3 of App. C. The heat capacities of solids and liquids are usually found by direct measurement. Correlations for the heat capacities of many solids and liquids are given by Perry and Green and in the DIPPR Project 801 collection.
We noted in Section 3. that as $P \rightarrow 0$ a gas approaches the ideal-gas state, wherein molecular volumes and intermolecular forces are negligible. If these conditions are imagined to persist with increasing pressure, a hypothetical ideal-gas state continues to exist at finite pressures. The gas still has properties reflective of its internal molecular configuration, just as does a real gas, but without the influence of intermolecular interactions. Accordingly, ideal-gas-state heat capacities, designated by $C_{P}^{i g}$ and $C_{V}^{i g}$, are functions of temperature, but independent of pressure, providing for ease of correlation. Fig. 4.1 illustrates the temperature dependence of $C_{P}^{i g}$ for several representative substances.
Statistical mechanics provides a basic equation for the temperature dependence of the ideal-gas-state internal energy:

Equation (3.10) for the ideal-gas state, $H^{i g}$ = $U^{i g}$ + $R T$, becomes:
In view of Eq. (2.19),The first term on the right represents translational kinetic energy of the molecule, whereas the second combines all rotational and vibrational kinetic energies associated with the molecule. Because the molecules of a monatomic gas have no energies of rotation or vibration, $f(T)$ in the preceding equation is zero. Thus, in Fig. 4.1 the value of $C_{P}^{i g} / R$  for argon is constant at a value of 5/2. For diatomic and polyatomic gases, $f(T)$ contributes importantly at all temperatures of practical importance. Diatomic molecules have a contribution equal to $R T$ from their two rotational modes of motion. Thus, in Fig. 4.1, $C_{P}^{l g} / R$ for N2 is about 7/2 R at moderate temperature, and it increases at higher temperatures as intramolecular vibration begins to contribute. Nonlinear polyatomic molecules have a contribution of 3/2 R from their three rotational modes of motion, and in addition usually have low-frequency vibrational modes that make an additional contribution at moderate temperature. The contribution becomes larger the more com- plex the molecule and increases monotonically with temperature, as is evident from the curves in Fig. 4.1 for H2O and CO2. The trend with molecular size and complexity is illustrated by the values of $C_{P}^{l g} / R$ at 298 K in Table C.1 of App. C.

The temperature dependence of $C_{P}^{i g}$ or $C_{V}^{i g}$  is determined by experiment, most often from spectroscopic data and knowledge of molecular structure through calculations based on statistical mechanics.3 Increasingly, quantum chemistry calculations, rather than spectroscopy experiments, are used to provide the molecular structure, and they often permit the calculation of heat capacities with precision comparable to experimental measurement. Where experi- mental data are not available, and quantum chemistry calculations are not warranted, methods of estimation are employed, as described by Prausnitz, Poling, and Oâ€™Connell.4

The temperature dependence of $C_{V}^{i g} / R$ follows from th temperature dependence of $C_{P}^{l g} / R$.
Although ideal-gas-state heat capacities are exactly correct for real gases only at zero pressure, the departure of real gases from the ideal-gas state is seldom significant at pressures below several bars, and here $C_{P}^{i g}$ and $C_{V}^{i g}$ are usually good approximations to their true heat capacities. Reference to Fig. 3.14 indicates a vast range of conditions at $P_{r}<0.1$ for which assumption of the ideal-gas state is usually a suitable approximation. For most substances $P_{c}$ exceeds 30 bar, which means that ideal-gas state behavior is often closely approximated up to a pressure of at least 3 bar.
Gas mixtures of constant composition behave exactly as do pure gases. In the ideal-gas state, molecules in mixtures have no influence on one another, and each gas exists independent of the others. The ideal-gas-state heat capacity of a mixture is therefore the mole-fraction- weighted sum of the heat capacities of the individual gases. Thus for gases $A$, $B$, and $C$, the molar heat capacity of a mixture in the ideal-gas state is:
P. 19 where $C_{P_{A}}^{i g}$, $C_{P_{B}}^{i g}$, and $C_{P_{C}}^{i g}$ are the molar heat capacities of pure $A$, $B$, and $C$ in the ideal-gas state, and $y_{A}$, $y_{B}$, and $y_{C}$ are mole fractions. Because the heat-capacity polynomial, Eq. (4.5), is linear in the coefficients, the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ for a gas mixture are similarly given by mole-fraction weighted sums of the coefficients for the pure species.
Evaluation of th integral $\int C_{P} d T$ is accomplished by substitution for $C_{P}$ as a function of $T$ by Eq. (4.4), followed by formal integration. For temperature limits of $T_{0}$ and $T$ the result is
Given $T_{0}$ and $T$, the calculation of $Q$ or $\Delta H$ is straightforward. Less direct is the calculation of $T$, given $T_{0}$  and $Q$ or $\Delta H$. Here, an iteration scheme may be useful. Factoring $\left(T-T_{0}\right)$ from each term on the right side of Eq. (4.8) gives:
We identify the quantity in square bracket as $\left(C_{P}\right\rangle_{H} / R$, where $\left\langle C_{P}\right\rangle_{H}$ is defined as a mean heat capacity for the temperature range from $T_{0}$  to $T$:
The angular bracket enclosing $C_{P}$ identify it as a mean value; subscript $H$ denotes a mean value specific to enthalpy calculations and distinguishes this mean heat capacity from a similar quantity introduced in the next chapter.  
With a starting value for T one can first evaluate $\left\langle C_{P}\right\rangle_{H}$ by Eq. (4.9). Substitution into Eq. (4.11) provides a new value of T from which to reevaluate $\left\langle C_{P}\right\rangle_{H}$. Iteration continues to convergence on a final value of $T$. Of course, such iteration is readily automated with built-in functions in a spreadsheet or a numerical analysis software package.

The integral $\int\left(C_{P} / R\right) d T$ appears often in thermodynamic calculations. As a matter of convenience, we therefore define the right side of Eq. (4.8) as the function, $\operatorname{ICPH}\left(T_{0}, T ; A, B, C, D\right)$, and presume the availability of a computer routine for its evaluation.6 Equation (4.8) then becomes:
The function name is ICPH (I indicates an integral) and the quantities in parentheses are the variables $T_{0}$ and $T$, followed by parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. When these quantities are assigned numerical values, the notation represents a value for the integral. Thus, for the evaluation of $Q$ in Ex. 4.2
Also useful is a defined function for the dimensionless mean value $\left\langle C_{P}\right\rangle_{H} / R$ given by Eq. (4.9). The function name is MCPH (M indicates a mean). The right side defines the function, $\operatorname{MCPH}\left(T_{0}, T ; A, B, C, D\right)$. With this definition, Eq. (4.9) becomes
P. 14
where for a pure species at temperature $T$, $\Delta H$  = latent heat = enthalpy change accompanying the phase change

$\Delta V$ = volume change accompanying the phase change

$P^{\text {sat }}$ = saturation pressure, i.e., the pressure at which the phase change occurs, which is a function only of T
The derivation of this equation, known as the Clapeyron equation, is given in Section 6.5. When Eq. (4.1) is applied to the vaporization of a pure liquid, $d P^{\mathrm{sat}} / d T$ is the slope of the vapor pressure-versus-temperature curve at the temperature of interest, $\Delta V$  is the difference between molar volumes of saturated vapor and saturated liquid, and $\Delta H$ is the latent heat of vaporization. Thus, $\Delta H$ may be calculated from vapor-pressure and volumetric data, yielding an energy value with units of pressure Ã— volume.
Rough estimates of latent heats of vaporization for pure liquids at their normal boiling points (indicated by subscript n) are given by Troutonâ€™s rule:where $T_{n}$ is the absolute temperature of the normal boiling point. The units of $\Delta H_{n}$, $R$, and $T_{n}$  are chosen so that $\Delta H_{n} / R T_{n}$ is dimensionless. Dating from 1884, this empirical rule provides a simple check on whether values calculated by other methods are reasonable. Representative experimental values for this ratio are Ar, 8.0; N2, 8.7; O2, 9.1; HCl, 10.4; C6H6, 10.5; H2S, 10.6; and H2O, 13.1. The high value for water reflects the existence of intermolecular hydro- gen bonds that rupture during vaporization.

where $P_{c}$ is the critical pressure in bars and $T_{r_{n}}$ is the reduced temperature at $T_{n}$. Equation (4.13) is surprisingly accurate for an empirical expression; errors rarely exceed 5 percent. Applied to water it gives
from which $\Delta H_{n}$ = (13.56)(8.314)(373.15) = 42,065 Jâ‹…molâˆ’1 This corresponds to 2334 Jâ‹…gâˆ’1; the steam-table value of 2257 Jâ‹…gâˆ’1 is lower by 3.4 percent. Estimates of the latent heat of vaporization of a pure liquid at any temperature from the known value at a single temperature are given by the method of Watson.11 The basis may be a known experimental value or a value estimated by Eq. (4.13):

Thus the enthalpy change caused by the combustion reaction is equal in magnitude to the heat flowing from the reaction products to the water, and may be calculated from the temperature rise and flow rate of the water. The enthalpy change of reaction $\Delta H$ is called the heat of reaction. If the reactants and products are in their standard states, then the heat effect is the standard heat of reaction
The standard states in use throughout the world have been established by general agreement. They are based on a standard-state pressure of 1 bar (105 Pa). With respect to composition, the standard states used in this chapter are states of pure species. For liquids and solids it is the actual state of the pure species at the standard-state pressure. Nothing could be simpler. However, for gases there is a small complication, as the chosen physical state is the ideal-gas state, for which we have already established heat capacities. In summary, the standard states used in this chapter are
 Gases:  The pure substance in the ideal-gas state at 1 bar.
 Liquids: and solids The real pure liquid or solid at 1 bar.

Property values in the standard state are denoted by the degree symbol. For example, $C_{P}^{\circ}$ is the standard-state heat capacity. Because the standard state for gases is the ideal-gas state, $C_{P}^{\circ}$ is identical with $C_{P}^{\mathrm{ig}}$, and the data of Table C.1 apply to the standard state for gases.

The symbol $\Delta H_{298}^{\circ}$ indicates that the heat of reaction is the standard value for a temperature of 298.15 K (25Â°C) and for the reaction as written. Heats of reaction at any temperature can be calculated from heat-capacity data if the value for one temperature is known; the tabulation of data can therefore be reduced to the compilation of standard heats of formation at a single temperature. The usual choice for this reference temperature is 298.15 K or 25Â°C. The standard heat of formation of a compound at this temperature is represented by the symbol $\Delta \mathrm{H}_{f_{298}^{\circ}}$. The degree symbol denotes the standard-state value, subscript f identifies a heat of formation, and the 298 is the rounded absolute temperature in kelvins. Tables of these values for common substances may be found in standard handbooks, but the most extensive compilations available are in specialized reference works.12 An abridged list of values is given in Table C.4 of App. C, and values for many additional compounds are given in publicly available online databases.

where $\nu_{i}$ is a stoichiometric coefficient and $A_{i}$ stands for a chemical formula. The species on the left are reactants; those on the right, products. The sign convention for $\nu_{i}$ is as follows
where $H_{i}^{\circ}$ is the enthalpy of species i in its standard state and the summation is over all products and reactants. The standard-state enthalpy of a chemical compound is equal to its heat of formation plus the standard-state enthalpies of its constituent elements. If the standard-state enthalpies of all elements are arbitrarily set equal to zero as the basis of calculation, then the standard-state enthalpy of each compound is simply its heat of formation. In this event, $H_{i}^{\circ}=\Delta H_{f_{i}}^{\circ}$ and Eq. (4.15) becomes

where subscript i identifies a particular product or reactant. Multiplying by Î½i and summing over all products and reactants gives:
The term $\sum_{i} \nu_{i} H_{i}^{\circ}$ is the standard heat of reaction, defined by Eq. (4.15) as $\Delta H^{\circ}$. The standard heat-capacity change of reaction is defined similarly
where $\Delta H^{\circ}$ and $\Delta H_{0}^{\circ}$ are the standard heats of reaction at temperature $T$ and at reference temperature $T_{0}$ respectively. This equation is more conveniently expressed as
The reference temperature $T_{0}$ must be a temperature for which the heat of reaction is known or can be calculated as described in the two preceding sections, most often 298.15 K. What Eq. (4.19) provides is the means for calculation of a heat of reaction at temperature $T$  from a known value at temperature $T_{0}$.

where "D"denotes $" \Delta . "$ The analogy requires simple replacement of $C_{P}$ by $\Delta C_{P}^{\circ}$ and of A, B, etc. by $\Delta A$, $\Delta B$, etc. The same computer routine serves for evaluation of either integral. The only difference is in the function name.
