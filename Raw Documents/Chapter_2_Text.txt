Heat $Q$ and work $W$ always refer to the system, and the choice of sign for numerical values of these quantities depends on which direction of energy transfer with respect to the system is regarded as positive. We adopt the convention that makes the numerical values of both quantities positive for transfer into the system from the surroundings. The corresponding quantities taken with reference to the surroundings, $Q_{\text {surr }}$ and $W_{\text {surr }}$, have the opposite sign, i.e., $Q_{\text {surr }}=-Q$ and $W_{\text {surr }}=-W$. With this understanding:

Closed systems often undergo processes during which only the internal energy of the system changes. For such processes, Eq. (2.2) reduces to: where $U^{t}$ is the total internal energy of the system. Equation (2.3) applies to processes of finite change in the internal energy of the system. For differential changes in $U^{t}$ :

In Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) the symbols $Q$, $W$, and $U^{t}$ pertain to the entire system, which may be of any size, but must be clearly defined. All terms require expression in the same energy units. In the SI system the unit is the joule.

Total volume $V^{t}$ and total internal energy $U^{t}$ depend on the quantity of material in a system, and are called extensive properties. In contrast, temperature and pressure, the principal thermodynamic coordinates for pure homogeneous fluids, are independent of the quantity of material, and are known as intensive properties. For a homogeneous system, an alternative means of expression for the extensive properties, such as $V^{t}$ and $U^{t}$, is: where the plain  symbols $V$ and $U$ represent the volume and internal energy of a unit amount of material, either a unit mass or a mole. These are specific or molar properties, respectively, and they are intensive, independent of the quantity of material actually present. Although $V^{t}$ and $U^{t}$ for a homogeneous system of arbitrary size are extensive properties, specific and molar volume $V$ and specific and molar internal energy $U$ are intensive.

Note that the intensive coordinates $T$ and $P$ have no extensive counterparts. For a closed system of $n$ moles, Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) may now be written:

Axiom 1: There exists a form of energy, known as internal energy $U$, which is an intrinsic property of a system, functionally related to the measurable coordinates that characterize the system. For a closed system, not in motion, changes in this property are given by Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6).

​​The systems most commonly found in chemical technology are fluids, for which the primary characteristics (properties) are temperature $T$, pressure $P$, specific or molar volume $V$, and composition. Such systems are known as $PVT$ systems. They exist at internal equilibrium when their properties are uniform throughout the system, and conform to the following axiom:

Imagine that mass $m$ is slid from the piston to a shelf (at the same level). The piston assembly accelerates upward, reaching maximum velocity when the upward force on the piston just balances its weight. Momentum then carries it to a higher level, where it reverses direction. If the piston were held in the position of maximum elevation, its potential-energy increase would very nearly equal the expansion work done by the gas. However, when unconstrained, the piston assembly oscillates, with decreasing amplitude, ultimately coming to rest at a new equilibrium position $\Delta l$ above the old.

The limiting case of removal of a succession of infinitesimal masses from the piston is approximated when the masses $m$ in Fig. $2.1$ are replaced by a pile of powder, blown in a very fine stream from the piston.

Thus heat is transferred reversibly when it flows from a finite object at temperature $T$ to another such object at temperature $T-dT$.

The concept of a reversible chemical reaction is illustrated by the decomposition of solid calcium carbonate to form solid calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. At equilibrium, this system exerts a specific decomposition pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for a given temperature. The chemical reaction is held in balance (in equilibrium) by the pressure of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Any change of conditions, however slight, upsets the equilibrium and causes the reaction to proceed in one direction or the other.

If the mass $m$ in Fig. $2.2$ is minutely increased, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ pressure rises, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ combines with $\mathrm{CaO}$ to form $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$, allowing the weight to fall. 

The system then has an identifiable set of properties, including pressure $P$. The second requirement is that the system be no more than infinitesimally displaced from mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. In this event, the internal pressure $P$ is never more than minutely out of balance with the external force, and we may make the substitution $F=PA$ that transforms Eq. (1.2) into Eq. (1.3). Processes for which these requirements are met are said to be mechanically reversible, and Eq. (1.3) may be integrated:

The group $U+PV$ naturally arises here and in many other applications. This suggests the definition, for convenience, of this combination as a new thermodynamic property. Thus, the mathematical (and only) definition of enthalpy is: where $H, U$, and $V$ are molar or unit-mass values. The preceding energy balance becomes:

All terms of Eq. (2.10) must be expressed in the same units. The product $P V$ has units of energy per mole or per unit mass, as does $U$; therefore $H$ also has units of energy per mole or per unit mass. In the SI system the basic unit of pressure is the pascal $\left(=1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-2}\right)$, and that of molar volume is cubic meters per mol $\left(=1 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\right)$. For the $P V$ product we have $1 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}=  \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

Our recognition of heat as energy in transit was preceded historically by the idea that gases, liquids, and solids have capacity for heat. The smaller the temperature change caused in a substance by the transfer of a given quantity of heat, the greater its capacity. Indeed, a heat capacity might be defined as $C \equiv d Q / d T$. The difficulty with this is that it makes $C$, like $Q$, a process-dependent quantity rather than a state function. However, it does suggest the definition of two quantities that, although they retain this outmoded name, are in fact state functions, unambiguously related to other state functions. The discussion here is preliminary to more complete treatment in Chapter $4$.

Observe carefully the notation used here with the partial derivative. The parentheses and subscript $V$ indicate that the derivative is taken with volume held constant; i.e., $U$ is considered a function of $T$ and $V$. This notation is widely used in this text and more generally in thermodynamics. It is needed because thermodynamic state functions, like $U$, can be written as functions of different sets of independent variables. Thus, we can write $U(T, V)$ and $U(T, P)$. Ordinarily in multivariable calculus, a set of independent variables is unambiguous, and a partial derivative with respect to one variable implies constancy of the others. Because thermodynamics reflects physical reality, one may deal with alternative sets of independent variables, introducing ambiguity unless the variables being held constant are explicitly specified.

The definition of Eq. (2.15) accommodates both the molar heat capacity and the specific heat capacity (usually called specific heat), depending on whether $U$ is the molar or specific internal energy. Although this definition makes no reference to any process, it relates in an especially simple way to a constant-volume process in a closed system, for which Eq. (2.15) may be written:

Again, the definition accommodates both molar and specific heat capacities, depending on whether $H$ is the molar or specific enthalpy. This heat capacity relates in an especially simple way to a constant-pressure, closed-system process, for which Eq. (2.19) is equally well written:

The measures of flow are interrelated: where $\mathcal{M}$ is molar mass and $A$ is the cross-sectional area for flow. Importantly, mass and molar flow rates relate to velocity:

The area for flow $A$ is the cross-sectional area of a conduit, and $\rho$ is specific or molar density. Although velocity is a vector quantity, its scalar magnitude $u$ is used here as the average speed of a stream in the direction normal to $A$. Flow rates $\dot{m}, \dot{n}$, and $q$ represent measures of quantity per unit of time. Velocity $u$ is quite different in nature, as it does not suggest the magnitude of flow. Nevertheless, it is an important design parameter.

The fluid within the control volume is the thermodynamic system for which mass and energy balances are written. Because mass is conserved, the rate of change of mass within the control volume, $d m_{\mathrm{cv}} / d t$, equals the net rate of flow of mass into the control volume. The convention is that flow is positive when directed into the control volume and negative when directed out. The mass balance is expressed mathematically by:

Two streams with flow rates $\dot{m}_{1}$ and $\dot{m}_{2}$ are shown directed into the control volume, and one stream with flow rate $\dot{m}_{3}$ is directed out.

The difference operator $\Delta$ here signifies the difference between exit and entrance flows, and the subscript "fs" indicates that the term applies to all flowing streams. 

Because energy, like mass, is conserved, the rate of change of energy within the control volume equals the net rate of energy transfer into the control volume. Streams flowing into and out of the control volume have associated with them energy in its internal, potential, and kinetic forms, and all may contribute to the energy change of the system. Each unit mass of a stream carries with it a total energy $U+\frac{1}{2} u^{2}+z g$, where $u$ is the average velocity of the stream, $z$ is its elevation above a datum level, and $g$ is the local acceleration of gravity. Thus, each stream transports energy at the rate $\left(U+\frac{1}{2} u^{2}+z g\right) \dot{m}$. The net energy transported into the system by the flowing streams is therefore $-\Delta\left[\left(U+\frac{1}{2} u^{2}+z g\right) \dot{m}\right]_{\mathrm{fs}}$, where the effect of the minus sign with " $\Delta$ " is to make the term read in - out. The rate of energy accumulation within the control volume includes this quantity in addition to the heat transfer rate $\dot{Q}$ and work rate:

This unit mass of fluid is acted upon by additional fluid, here replaced by a piston that exerts the constant pressure $P$. The work done by this piston in moving the unit mass through the entrance is $P V$, and the work rate is $(P V) \dot{m}$. Because $\Delta$ denotes the difference between exit and entrance quantities, the net work done on the system when all entrance and exit sections are taken into account is $-\Delta[(P V) \dot{m}]_{\mathrm{fs}}$

Another form of work is the shaft work $^{9}$ indicated in Fig. $2.5$ by rate $\dot{W}_{s}$. In addition, work may be associated with expansion or contraction of the entire control volume. These forms of work are all included in a rate term represented by $\dot{W}$. The preceding equation may now be written:

The velocity $u$ in the kinetic-energy terms is the bulk-mean velocity as defined by the equation $u=\dot{m} /(\rho A)$. Fluids flowing in pipes exhibit a velocity profile that rises from zero at the wall (the no-slip condition) to a maximum at the center of the pipe. The kinetic energy of a fluid in a pipe depends on its velocity profile. For the case of laminar flow, the profile is parabolic, and integration across the pipe shows that the kinetic-energy term should properly be $u^{2}$. In fully developed turbulent flow, the more common case in practice, the velocity across the major portion of the pipe is not far from uniform, and the expression $u^{2} / 2$, as used in the energy equations, is more nearly correct.

A further specialization results when the control volume has one entrance and one exit. The same mass flow rate $\dot{m}$ then applies to both streams, and Eq. (2.29) reduces to: where subscript "fs" has been omitted in this simple case and $\Delta$ denotes the change from entrance to exit. 

However, in Eq. (2.32), enthalpy rather than internal energy is the thermodynamic property of importance, and $\Delta$ refers to a change from inlet to outlet, rather than from before to after an event.

Measurements of the heat transfer rate and flow rate allow calculation of the change $\Delta H$ between sections 1 and 2. For example, enthalpies of both liquid and vapor $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ are readily determined. The constant-temperature bath is filled with a mixture of crushed ice and water to maintain a temperature of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Liquid water is supplied to the apparatus, and the coil that carries it through the constant-temperature bath is long enough to bring it to an exit temperature of essentially $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ . The temperature and pressure at section 2 are measured by suitable instruments. Values of the enthalpy of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for various conditions at section 2 are given by

where $Q$ is the heat added per unit mass of water flowing. The pressure may vary from run to run, but in the range encountered here it has a negligible effect on the enthalpy of the entering water, and for practical purposes $H_{1}$ is a constant. Absolute values of enthalpy, like absolute values of internal energy, are unknown. An arbitrary value may therefore be assigned to $H_{1}$ as the basis for all other enthalpy values.
